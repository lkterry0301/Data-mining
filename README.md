# CSE-5243 -- Intro To Data Mining

####Lab 1 Description
The objective is to preprocess data and prepare it for automated categorization, document similarity search, and building document graphs. This assignment is the first part of a longer-term project. The objective is to give you the experience of preprocessing real data and preparing it for classification. Your objectives are to construct a refined data set composed of a feature vector and class label(s) for each article in the Reuter(s) dataset.  I would like you to use the class labels as provided in the TOPICS and PLACES tabs of each article. We will discuss the exact details of the requirements in class on Tuesday. The datasets (split among multiple (21) .sgm files) can be obtained from http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~srini/674/public/reuters/  (you may also directly access this through the UNIX filesystem at ~srini/WWW/674/public/reuters). The format of individual documents within the file is similar to the sample document below. 

You are encouraged to construct two or more types of feature vectors (for instance you could use just the titular words or the frequency of words in the body of the article, or weighted words to construct your vector -- these are 3 of the simpler ones) that we will discuss in class. More complicated strategies would be to limit the number of elements in your feature vector. You have complete choice on the programming environment as long as it will execute on the STDLINUX environment. Note â€“ you are welcome to implement standalone code (Java or Python suggested) for this project and/or leverage free software such as Apache Lucene as long as you can concisely and precisely explain how to run the program in your report or README file.
